If you need to choose both from c colors and a agents for each block in the grid, and you can choose each 
color and each agent independently and with repetition allowed, then the total number of combinations C 
can be calculated as:

C = (c * a)^b

In this formula, c represents the number of colors, a represents the number of agents, and b is the 
total number of blocks in the grid. So, the formula for the number of combinations when choosing both
from c colors and a agents for each cell is (c * a)^b.

If a = 2, c = 6, and b = 6:

C = (c * a)^b = (6 * 2)^6 = 12^6 = 2,985,984
